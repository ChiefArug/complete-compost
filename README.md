# Complete Compost
A mod for Minecraft Forge about compost. That's it. Plants go brrrrr


### What?
Adds two blocks, compost and mystical compost. 
#### - Compost 
  Speeds up the growth of crops above it by redirecting any random ticks it recieves. 
  It can stack infinitely as long as there is only compost or farmland between it and the crop.
  Can be waterlogged which improves growth rates (for plants that want water, like wheat) and allows sugar cane to be planted on it without a nearby water source.
  
 #### - Mystical Compost
  Speeds up the growth of any block above it by redirecting random ticks it recieves.
  This means it can speed up blocks like budding amethyst.
  Just like regular Compost it can stack infinitely as long as there is only compost or farmland between it and the crop
  Can be waterlogged which improves growth rates and allows sugar cane to be planted on it without a nearby water source.
  
  
 ### How?
 You can obtain compost by right clicking any dirt block on a composter, it will consume one level of compost.
 Craft a piece of compost with 4 amethyst shards to get two mystical compost.
